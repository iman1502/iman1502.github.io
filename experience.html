<p align="justify">Becoming the leader of a program involving an orphanage and UITM students was both a daunting and exhilarating experience. As I reflect on the journey, it is evident that the impact of the last video encapsulates a myriad of emotions that have become an integral part of this transformative experience.</p>

<p align="justify">Taking on the role of a leader in such a program required meticulous planning and a keen understanding of the dynamics involved. The responsibility of ensuring the smooth execution of the program rested heavily on my shoulders. Every decision had to be carefully considered, taking into account potential risks and challenges that could arise. It became apparent that being a leader goes beyond merely making choices; it involves a comprehensive evaluation of all aspects involved in the program.</p>

<p align="justify">	One crucial aspect was the collaboration between the orphanage and the UITM students. Balancing the needs and expectations of both parties required a delicate touch. Striking the right chord meant not only focusing on the organizational aspects but also fostering an environment where all participants felt heard and valued. Opinions and suggestions from all sides were not just encouraged but embraced, recognizing that a successful program was the result of collective efforts.</p>

<p align="justify">	The journey was not without its apprehensions. When first appointed as the head of the program, a wave of fear washed over me. The weight of the responsibility coupled with the desire not to disappoint my peers who entrusted me with the leadership role created a unique blend of anxiety and determination. The faith they placed in me stemmed from my prior experience in the field of management, a foundation I intended to build upon.</p>

<p align="justify">	As the leader, I had to navigate challenges, make tough decisions, and ensure that the team remained motivated and focused on the common goal. The program's success hinged on effective communication, strategic planning, and the ability to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. Each step, from conceptualizing the program to overseeing its execution, required a delicate balance between leadership and collaboration.</p>

<p align="justify">	The last video serves as a powerful reminder of the collective efforts invested in the program. Witnessing the culmination of the project and the positive impact it had on both the orphanage and the UITM students evokes a sense of pride and fulfillment. The spectrum of emotions experienced throughout the journey – from initial apprehension to ultimate satisfaction – adds depth to the narrative, making it a truly memorable and transformative leadership experience.</p>

<p align="justify">In conclusion, being the leader of a program involving an orphanage and UITM students was a journey of self-discovery, growth, and resilience. The last video encapsulates not only the tangible outcomes of the program but also the intangible emotions that have left an indelible mark on my leadership journey.</p>
