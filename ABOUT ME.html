	 I love cycling. Since when? since i was a litle kid but back then I hve no money to bought an a bicyle. I dont want to burden my family only to satisdy my desires. Back a few months ago, I took advantage of the chance to work to fulfill my needs with my own money. And guess what ? I did it and buy the bicycle with my own money. I feel very excited about it. But that doesnt end there. Back when I was a kid I thought cycling is not that tired but I was wrong. I saw many people have the same kind of bike with me which is roadbike have paddled for hundreds of kilometer I want to do it but it feel so exhausted. Now my journey to become an elite cycler have began. I want to keep on improving myself so that I can join a tournemant to compete with other cyclers.  My friends afiq, fahmi and amy also have the same interest as me. Amy also just bought a bike and we are both training to qualify to enter the tournament.

	To embark on a rewarding cycling journey, start with a well-maintained bike and the essential safety gear, including a helmet. Set clear goals, be it enhancing endurance, speed, or conquering specific distances. Begin gradually, with consistent rides, around 3-5 times weekly, mixing it up between road, mountain, and indoor cycling for variety and a full-body workout. Prioritize warm-ups, incorporating dynamic stretches, and aim for longer endurance rides to build stamina. To boost speed and strength, integrate interval training, and embrace the challenge of hill climbs. Group rides and social connections can keep you motivated and foster learning from experienced cyclists. Allow time for recovery with easy rides and pay attention to nutrition, hydration, and bike safety. Stretch post-ride for flexibility and track your progress in a training log. Remember, cycling should be enjoyable; adapt your training to your fitness level, and always put safety and fun first!
